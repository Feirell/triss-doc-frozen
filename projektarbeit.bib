    abstract = {WebGL is a technique that allows the browser to run 3D applications with the help of the GPU. Voronoi diagrams are a set of polygons that can be used to illustrate worlds of islands. In an web-application using Voronoi Polygons to create two dimensional worlds there is a future vision to enable three dimensional behavior. There are multiple frameworks and libraries that can be used to simplify the process of creating 3D applications in the browser. Due to the fact that 3D applications can be performance demanding, an experiment was conducted with BabylonJS and Three.js. In order to evaluate which one of the two performed better, RAM, GPU and CPU were evaluated when translating two dimensional Voronoi heightmaps into a 3D application. The results from this stress test prove that Three.js outperformed BabylonJS. },

    keywords = {Egress, Agent-based model, Scalar Field Method, Leader–follower model, Social collective behavior},
    abstract = {There is growing consensus that individuals egressing during emergencies engage in social collective behavior that is ordered and cooperative. Despite this fact however, a great many of the existing models either do not account for this type of behavior or model it in an inadequate manner. In this paper, a leader–follower agent-based model is proposed to interpret local social interactions and collective behavior and then use this information to mimic three particular scenarios: lining up in counter-flow, queuing, and collective mobility. To achieve this, a pedestrian agent can establish informal and transient leader–follower relationships with others while adjusting its behavioral patterns as warranted by the situation. The proposed model is calibrated to existing field data and then validated using another set of field data, where it is shown that the new model is capable of reasonably simulating social collective behavior during egress.}
